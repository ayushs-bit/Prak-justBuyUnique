    <h2>
        1. Accepting These Terms
<p>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short).

The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Prak. If you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you and Prak, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you and Prak Ireland UC, a subsidiary of Prak, Inc. We’ll just refer to Prak, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries collectively as “Prak”.

   </h2>
    <h2>
        2. Those Other Documents We Mentioned
<p>Prak’s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending on how you use the Services:

Our House Rules for Everyone. If you use any of our Services, you agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Anti-Discrimination Policy.

    </h2>
    <h2>
        3. Your Privacy
<p> know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. Our Privacy Policy details how your information is used when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it here.

Both Prak and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and delivery address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not Prak, will be responsible for that unauthorised disclosure.  

    </h2>
    <h2>
        4. Your Account with Prak
        <p>
            You’ll need to create an account with Prak to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about accounts with Etsy:

A. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 years are not permitted to use Prak or the Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be commercial products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a minor's access to material online. For more information, see Prak's Minors Policy.

B. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.

        </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        5. Your Content
        <p>
            Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.).

A. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.
       </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        6. Your Use of Our Services
        <p>
            License to Use Our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services - subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:

A. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licences that your shop requires, and to meet applicable legal requirements in applicable jurisdiction(s). This includes the sale and delivery of your items, such as age verification upon delivery, where required by law. You may not sell anything that violates any laws; you must comply with our Sanctions Policy, and you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Prak, another Prak user, or a third party.

  </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        
        7. Disputes with Other Users
        <p>
            If you find yourself in a dispute with another user of Prak’s Services or a third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute amicably.

Case System. Buyers and sellers who are unable to resolve a dispute related to a transaction on our websites or mobile apps may participate in our case system. You can find details about the case system in this Help article. Prak will attempt to help you resolve disputes in good faith and based solely on our interpretation of our policies, in our sole discretion; we will not make judgments regarding legal issues or claims. Prak has no obligation to resolve any disputes.

Release of Prak. You release Etsy from any claims, demands, and damages arising out of disputes with other users or parties.
        </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        8. Changes to the Terms
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know by posting the changes through the Services and/or sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using the Services. Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes unless otherwise specified. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of the Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        9. Some Finer Legal Points
        <p>
            The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and Prak regarding the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.
        </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
        10. Contact Information
        <p>
            If you have any questions about the Terms, please email us at Prakinc@gmail.com.

*In some countries you may have additional rights and/or the preceding may not apply to you
